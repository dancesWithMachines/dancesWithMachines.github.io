While this blog is mostly focused on "computer stuff", I do have other hobbies
that will pop up here from time to time. One of these is motorcycles, and here’s
my machine:

![shower](../../assets/posts/kawasaki-z250sl-maintenance-summary/shower.jpeg)

I own a 2016 Kawasaki Z250SL (no ABS). This is my first motorcycle, and my first
full season of riding is coming to an end, which means: **annual maintenance**.
I did a full service at the beginning of spring, but being the genius I am, I
was too lazy to write down all the parts and procedures that would make my life
easier next time. Well, the time has come, and it’s finally time to fix that
oversight.

The idea for this post is to turn it into a knowledge source about the
**Kawasaki Z250SL**. Mostly for me, but it might just be helpful for others as
well. Instead of doing multiple posts about this machine, I’ll keep this post up
to date by adding content here.

So, to all three people who read this blog regularly: don’t worry, you won’t be
spammed with my little green runabout.
